# Conjurites

**I'm Aymen aka Conjurites and many names, I consider myself as a Software Developer and CTF Lover (Bug Bounty Hunter in bad times).**

## Skills:

- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Problems Solving

**I'm not stable in one programming language, I change from language to language (because I'm always curious), but if you ask me, I prefer Python / Go, I like to do whatever contains coding.**
